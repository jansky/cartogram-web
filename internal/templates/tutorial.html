        <h3>1. Select a Map</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">On the right-hand side of the 'Input'
        section, there are currently several maps to choose from. If
        you select a map, the display below will update to display the
        conventional land-area version of the map, and a population
        cartogram.</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tutimg/new1-e.png') }}" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tutorial Image: Select Map"/>

        <h3>2. Fill In Your Data</h3>

	<p class="text-justify">The easiest wayt to fill in your data
	  is to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or
	  LibreOffice Calc. Click the 'Download CSV Template' button
	  on the left-hand side of the 'Input' section. You can open
	  the downloaded template with the spreadsheet program of your
	  choice.</p>

	<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tutimg/new3.png') }}" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tutorial Image: Template File"/>
        <br/><br/>

	<p class="text-justify">The province or state column, as well
	  as the population column, are for reference only. You will
	  need to insert your data into the third column, and change
	  the header for the third column to match the name of your
	  dataset.  If you do not like the default colour scheme, you
	  may also specify your own colour for each region by using
	  hexadecimal colour codes.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">For more information about suitable
        datasets and colour codes, please see
          the <a href="{{url_for('faq')}}">FAQ</a>.</p>

	<p class="text-justify">When you've filled in the template
        with your data and colour information, go back to the
        go-cart.io website and click 'Upload Data' in the top right
        corner of the website. Once you select your CSV file to
        upload, cartogram generation will begin. The time it takes to
        generate a cartogram varies, but it averages around a few
        seconds.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Alternatively, in a pinch you may use
        the built-in editing interface, which can be launched by
        clicking the 'Edit' button on the far right-hand side of the
        input section.</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tutimg/new2.png') }}" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tutorial Image: Grid Document"/>
        <br/><br/>
        <p class="text-justify">The editor interface functions like a
        spreadsheet program. Again, the region name and population
        columns are for reference only, and cannot be changed. You
        will need to insert your data into the third column. You
        should also fill in the title of your dataset into the header
        for the third column.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">When you are done filling in your
        data, click the 'Update' button at the top of the editor
        interface to generate your cartogram.</p>

        <h3>3. View, Download, and Share Your Cartogram</h3>

        <p class="text-justify">When your cartogram has finished
        generating, our website provides several interactive tools to
        help you analyze it. Hovering over each region displays
        detailed information about that region in a
        tooltip. Additionally, you may switch between your cartogram,
        a population cartogram, and the land area map by using the
        dropdown in the right hand column.</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tutimg/new4-e.png') }}" class="img-fluid my-4" alt="Tutorial Image: Cartogram Selector"/>

        <p class="text-justify">You may also download an SVG version
        of each of these maps by using the buttons below each
        map. Finally, you can also share your map on social media by
        using the button at the bottom of the page.</p>
